# This script serves as an example of how to use the -e and -r options for
# Souffle.
#
# They make information available which allows each strata of a Datalog
# program to be evaluated in isolation.
#
# For each strata, this script shows how to:
#
# - get the input relations of a strata
# - get the output relations of a strata
# - get the relations produced by a strata
# - get the relations consumed by a strata
# - get a topological order over the strata
# - execute a strata as an independent subprogram
# - the locations of input, output, and intermediate files
#
# This should be enough to get Kafka working with Souffle; Each relation is a
# topic, each node is a stratum, all IO is via files.
