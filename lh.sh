# @TODO
# - put most of Mpi.h in an Mpi.cpp, too much in header
# - do not use anonymous namespaces in Mpi.h, maybe ok in cpp file
# - do documentation for whole of Mpi.h class
# - get it working with zero arity predicates
# - do debugging macros
# - must ensure that sends and receives are in the same order, they have to sync up
# - get travis tests working
# - ensure that removing mpi output works in testsuite.at for .out files
# - merge with upstream branch
